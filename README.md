## 🌐 Advanced Features & Tech Stack

This project combines several AI and rule-based techniques to detect scam offers:

- 🤖 **AI-Powered Classification:** Uses a pre-trained *Hugging Face Transformers* model for zero-shot text classification, distinguishing legitimate offers from scams.
- 🚩 **Rule-Based Scanning:** Applies custom regex rules to flag phrases indicating urgency, upfront payments, requests for sensitive info, and other common scam signals.
- 🕵️ **Entity Consistency Checks:** Extracts entities (organizations, people) with **spaCy** and cross-verifies them against email domains (catching mismatches between claimed company names and sender addresses).
- 🔗 **Link & Domain Verification:** Detects suspicious URLs or free email domains (e.g., Gmail, Yahoo) using heuristic checks to warn about unofficial contact points.
- 📝 **Grammar & Writing Analysis:** Leverages **LanguageTool** to evaluate grammar and spelling; many scam emails contain noticeable errors or unusual phrasing.
- 📊 **Structural Similarity:** Compares the email's structure to real job offers using **SentenceTransformers** embeddings, indicating how closely the message resembles a typical legitimate offer.
- 🖥️ **Streamlit Web App:** Provides an interactive dashboard to input email text and review analysis results, with clear highlighting and scoring for each detection layer.
